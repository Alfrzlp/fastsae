Description: Provides fast implementations of small area estimation (SAE) 
    methods using C++ and RcppArmadillo for computational efficiency. 
    The package currently supports the Fay-Herriot model with options 
    for maximum likelihood (ML) and restricted maximum likelihood (REML) 
    estimation, efficient estimation of regression coefficients, 
    empirical best linear unbiased predictors (EBLUPs), mean squared 
    error (MSE) components, and related model diagnostics (AIC, BIC, 
    log-likelihood). Designed for large-scale applications where standard 
    R implementations are too slow.
